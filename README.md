# Weight of Items
```
This plugin introduces a new mechanic to the game - the weight of items. 
Now each item has its own weight, which is added to the player's inventory.
The more weight you carry, the more your movement is slowed down. 
If the weight exceeds the critical mark, the player will not be able to move at all. 
Keep an eye on your equipment to stay mobile!

# Full customization for your server!

Everything in this plugin can be finely tuned to the needs and atmosphere of your project!
Flexible effects settings: You set yourself at what weight the player starts to slow down, how strong this slowdown will be, and at what value he will be completely immobilized.

Control over each item: You can assign an individual weight to any item in Minecraft - from a feather to a gold ingot. Make some things light and others really heavy to create a balanced and unique weight economy.

The plugin gives administrators full control to create the perfect gaming experience.
